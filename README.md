'"Deep Neural Network Application - v3"' and '"dnn_utils_v2.py"' are available in the programming assignments from the 4th week. Please download and save them locally. If you're using the code from this repository, simply copy and paste the code from the L_layer_model function into the corresponding cell.

You can access the Titanic Survival data sets from Kaggle here:
